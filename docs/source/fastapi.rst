FastAPI
=======

*new in 0.9.0*

Since both FastAPI and Pandera integrates seamlessly with Pydantic, you can
use the :py:class:`~pandera.model.SchemaModel` types to validate incoming
or outgoing data with respect to your API endpoints.

Using SchemaModels to Validate Endpoint Inputs and Outputs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Suppose we want to process transactions, where each transaction has an
``id`` and ``cost``. We can model this with a pandera schema model:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-14

Also suppose that we expect our endpoint to add a ``name`` to the transaction
data:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 22-25

Let's also assume that the output of the endpoint should be a list of dictionary
records containing the named transactions data. We can do this easily with the
``to_format`` option in the schema model :py:class:`~pandera.typing.config.BaseConfig`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 34-37

Note that the ``to_format_kwargs`` is a dictionary of key-word arguments
to be passed into the respective pandas ``to_{format}`` method.

.. TODO: create new page for the to/from_format config option

Next we'll create a FastAPI app and define a ``/transactions/`` POST endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/app.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 3,6,15-16,23-28


Reading File Uploads
--------------------

Similar to the ``TransactionsDictOut`` example to convert dataframes to a
particular format as an endpoint response, pandera also provides a
``from_format`` schema model configuration option to read a dataframe from
a particular serialization format.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 17-19

Let's also define a response model for the ``/file/`` upload endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 28-32,46-48

In the next example, we use the pandera
:py:class:`~pandera.typing.fastapi.UploadFile` type to upload a parquet file
to the ``/file/`` POST endpoint and return a response containing the filename
and the modified data in json format.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/fastapi/app.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 7,30-38

Pandera's :py:class:`~pandera.typing.fastapi.UploadFile` type is a subclass of FastAPI's
`UploadFile <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/?h=uploadfile#uploadfile>`__
but it exposes a ``.data`` property containing the pandera-validated dataframe.

Takeaway
--------

With the FastAPI and Pandera integration, you can use Pandera
:py:class:`~pandera.model.SchemaModel` types to validate the dataframe inputs
and outputs of your FastAPI endpoints.
